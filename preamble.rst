Preamble
========

A single XPL device varies within the XPL device family in it's hardware
configuration, i.e. there are various product variants available, for different
usage scenarios and/or different mounting options.

However, all device variants feature a common device API to access the device's
data and configure it to customer needs. This API is available as a RESTful HTTP
service on every single device.

And this document describes the resources that make up this official API.

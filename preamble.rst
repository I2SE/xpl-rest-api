Preamble
========

A single Marjoram device varies within the Marjoram device family in it's hardware
configuration, i.e. there are various product variants available, for different
usage scenarios. However, all device variants feature a common device API to
access the device's data and configure it to customer needs. This API is
available as a RESTful HTTP service on every single device. And this document
describes the resources that make up this official API.
